# POMODORO

A lightweight pomodoro timer for the mac command line. 

## Features

It has COLOURED TEXT

It SPEAKS! 

... ok... that is literally it... (I should really stop procrastinating...) 

## Usage 

Download the file.

Make ./pomodoro executable by running:

```console
chmod +x ./pomodoro
```
open it up!

You can also add the file into your path somewhere so that you can just run it as a command from anywhere on your system.
