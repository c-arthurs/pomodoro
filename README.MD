# POMODORO

A lightweight pomodoro timer for the mac command line. 

## Features

1. It has COLOURED TEXT
2. It SPEAKS! 

... ok... that is literally it... (I should really stop procrastinating...) 

## Usage 

Clone the repo and make ./pomodoro executable by running:

```console
git clone git@github.com:c-arthurs/pomodoro.git
cd pomodoro
chmod +x ./pomodoro
./pomodoro
```
That should get it running!

You can also move the file into your path somewhere so that you can just run it as a command from anywhere on your system.
